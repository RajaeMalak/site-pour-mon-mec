            My favorite day with you is a memory I will never forget. It was the first time we went out together, and everything about it felt special. I wasn’t feeling my best that day; I was sick, but I wanted to be with you more than anything. I remember how you looked at me, with that soft concern in your eyes. You kept asking me if I was okay, if I needed anything, and I could feel your worry, even though you tried to stay calm.
          <br> We walked around, and despite my discomfort, being with you made everything feel better. You stayed by my side the entire time, holding my hand gently, as if you were afraid that letting go would somehow hurt me even more. I saw a side of you that day – a side that was full of care, tenderness, and love – and I knew right then how much you truly cared for me. I couldn’t stop thinking about how blessed I was to have someone like you by my side.
        </p>

        <p>
            You were patient with me, you didn’t rush anything, and you made me feel safe, even when I was physically weak. I’ll never forget how you kept reassuring me, telling me everything would be fine, and how you never left my side, even when I was feeling worse.
            
          
        </p>

            I know you love me deeply, and your love makes me feel so happy and safe. I'm truly sorry that I can't fully return those feelings in the same way
          <br>
          but please believe me when I say that I’m trying now to love you like I did at the beginning. 
          <br>
          I just can't help but feel that I won't find someone like you. You have this unique way of loving me,
        </p>
        <p>
            and deep down, I know that no one else could ever make me feel the way you do. 
         <br>  It's just that I can’t find anyone like you. You have such a pure heart,
        </p>
        <p>
            and the way you love me is something truly special – a love no one else could ever offer.

          You know, I wasn’t the kind of person who cared much about who stayed or left in my life. But with you, everything changed. Suddenly, it matters—a lot. I don’t know why, but I just can’t imagine a life without you anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I promise, no matter what life throws at us, I’ll always stand by your side, holding your hand. You are my world, and without you, everything feels empty. You’ve taught me what love truly means, and for that, I’ll cherish you forever.



        </p>
        <p>
          My love, there aren’t enough words in this world to describe how much you mean to me. You’re not just a part of my life; you are my life. Every breath I take feels meaningful because you exist.
          When I look at you, I don’t just see a person; I see my home, my peace, and my forever. You’ve become the reason I smile, the reason I dream, and the reason I believe in love. Without you, everything feels incomplete.
          😍

          Thank you for being with me, Yassine❤️. You’re the only person who has seen me in every situation—happy, sad, bored, angry, smiling, or crying. You’ve been there through it all.

You’re the one I trust deeply, the only one I can share every problem with, knowing you’ll understand. Not once have you ever disappointed me, and that means more to me than I could ever say. Thank you for being my strength, my comfort, and my everything.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, I hope you feel how deeply I care about you, with all my heart and soul. </p>
        <p>You mean everything to me.</p>
